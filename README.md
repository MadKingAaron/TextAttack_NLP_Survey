# TextAttack NLP Survey

## Requirements

 - TextAttack
 - Tensorflow
 - Tensorflow Text
 - PyTorch

## Instructions to Get Results

 1. Run `run_test_cmd.py` in order to obtain the benchmark results for the various attack-target pairings and generate adversarial inputs
 2. Run `collect_stats.py` in order to obtain statistics about the results of the various attack-target pairings
 3. Run `test_electra.py` in order to obtain discriminator benchmarks of the previously generated adversarial inputs
